= What to expect from 1.4!

:hp-tags: TGB's Extension

[%hardbreaks]
I've been working on some cool new features to TGB's Extension 1.4, they include:

- The "Query Parameter (parameter name)" block.

It acts just like the $_GET method in PHP.
Each parameter is set in the url by using the following format: +
?<param>=<value>&<paramN>=<value>

Example:
URL: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/41561058/?holidayspecial=false +
Block output when using "holidayspecial" as a parameter: false
